In this project,I improved my understanding and practice of the most important react topics such as hooks, folder structure and state management.I used Redux toolkit for state management and axios for working with http requests for the first time in one of the my projects and fouund them really awesome. Concerning the features,in this project user can login or resgiter and also update their profiles. Besides,They can add jobs, delete and edit them if it is needed.
